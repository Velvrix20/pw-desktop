### Overview

This is an efficient, and lightweight desktop app implementation of the [PhysicsWallah](https://pw.live) website. 

They have a really nice website, but running within a browser tab is not always efficient and can be sometimes distracting, so that is why I made this desktop with Tauri, a modern rust framework.

I had not written some Rust code in a while so I made this simple project to brush up my Rust skills a bit (still very beginner, and contributions are very welcome).
